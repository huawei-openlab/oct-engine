##The `Test Case Server` provides valid testcases for the user/developer or the `Scheduler` to use.
It reads the `cases` directory from this `oct` project, checks the validation and provides [APIs](API.md).

- [How to use the `tcserver`](#howto)
- [How does the test case organized](#how-do-the-case-files-been-organized)
- [How to submit a test case](#submit)
- [How to generate the report](reportGenerator/README.md)
- [How to verify the case](caseValidator/HowTO.md)

###HowTo
####HowToRun
Compile the tcserver by using 'Make', modify the [Config](tcserver.conf) to your own preference and run the tcserver.

```
make
./tcserver
```

If you may see the output like this:
```
Error in loading case:  /tmp/tcserver_cache/oct/cases/specstest/namespace  . Skip it
Error in loading case:  /tmp/tcserver_cache/oct/cases/specstest/root_readonly_false  . Skip it
Listen to port  :8011
```
It means there is something wrong with these two cases, please use the [Case Validator Tool](../tools/casevalidator/HowTO.md) to correct them.

####HowToUse
Read the [APIs](API.md)

```
curl localhost:8011/case
```
You may see the output like this:
```

```

If you want to get the files of a single case, you can:

```
curl localhost:8011/case/5e1bde28cdf2ea66b41c7a7508f744cf > version_correct.tar.gz
```
The version_correct.tar.gz file could used by the `Schedular` service to and the whole testing will be completed after that.

###How do the case files been organized
The ideal case struct should be like this [case bundle](https://github.com/huawei-openlab/oct-engine/blob/master/cases/spec.md#case-bundle):

```
casedir
  |__ group one
  |        |_____ case one
  |        |_____ case two
  |
  |__ group two
  |__ group three
	   |____  case three
			|___ config.json
			|___ source/container-file
			|___ source/container-script one
			|___ report.md

```

But currently, the following flexiable format is also supported.

```
casedir
  |__ group one
  |           |___ case four
  |                      |____  case-four-name.json
  |                      |____  source/case-four-files
  |___ group two
              |___  case five
              |           |____ case-five-name.json
              |           |____ source/case-five-files
              |___  case six
              |___  LibOne  (LibOne is used in case-five and case-six
                          |____ files
                          
```

In the `flexiable format`, we need to configurate the `Test Case Server`, for example:
[Demo configuration](tcserver.conf)
```

{
	"GitRepo":  "https://github.com/huawei-openlab/oct.git",
        "CaseFolderName":  "cases",
	"Groups": [ 
		{"Name": "specstest",
		 "LibFolderName": "source"
		},
		{"Name": "benchmark/monitor",
		 "LibFolderName" : "source"
		}
	],
	"CacheDir": "/tmp/tcserver_cache/",
	"Port":  8011
}
```

###submit
Before submit case to the repo, please use the [Case Validator Tool](../tools/casevalidator/HowTO.md) to check its validation.

After that, please submit to this OCT repo and put your case under the 'cases' directory.
